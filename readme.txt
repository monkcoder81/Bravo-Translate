== Frequently Asked Questions ==
==Some texts are not translated how can I fix it?==

If one of your texts is not translated, inspect your source code and check how they are written in your html. Sometimes the text is altered by css uppercasing. Other times some html tags  may be inside your texts. Do not hesitate to copy thouse html tags.

For instance lets suppose you have this in your source code :

 <h1>This is my <b>super</b> title</h1>
 
The translation of the text "This is my super title" will not work. Instead, copy  "This is my <b>super</b> title" and insert it at the Text to Translate field.

==Does this plugin slows my site?==

This plugin has a very low impact in your page loading time. However try to limit very shorts texts to translate ( text with only 2 or 3 characters long). The plugin will find a lot of ocurrences of thouse short texts and it will have a lot of job to do deciding if it is text to translate or not. 
If you put a lot of texts with just 2 characters, you may increase the loading time by a some millisecs (of course that will also depend on your server performance).
